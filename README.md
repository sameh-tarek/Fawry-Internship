## About 

This repository serves as a record of the resources and tasks I'm working on during my internship at [Fawry](https://www.fawry.com/). My focus is on mastering full-stack development using **Spring Boot** and **Angular**. By documenting my learning journey, I hope to keep things organized and make it easier for others to access valuable knowledge. I believe that the content shared here will benefit anyone interested in full-stack development and contribute to the broader learning community.
